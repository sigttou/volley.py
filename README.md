# volley.py
Simple script to parse volleynet.at live stats to get match thread info

## TODO: 
* Ask user for some info at first run (type of league / streams / other links...)
* differ between start/update/end of thread
* Reddit api handling / actually let the bot update threads / config file
* Make the code look better
* Let user add dynamic match updates
